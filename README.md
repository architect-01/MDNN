# MDNN
Deep Learning Library built using Python and Numpy and inspired by Keras(Tensorflow) for the purpose of reminding myself of the Deep Learning concepts.

There are large number of improvements that can be made: different optimizers, different loss functions, etc. They will be added in the next month or so.

Folder 'examples' showcases how Sequential models are built and I recommend you to first go through it, as to gain the high-level overview.

Library components:
- Dense(Fullyconnected) layer
- Activation layer
- Convolutional layer
- Flatten layer

Upcoming changes will include:
- Adding MaxPooling layer
- Changes to the interface (primarily how the models are built)
